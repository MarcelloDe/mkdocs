<h1>Get Things Done: Robert Kelsey</h1>

<p>The books begins with analyzing The marshmallow test' to understand why some people are productive and others are not... Yet this leaves one question unanswered. Why would one child develop strong awareness and acceptance of external influences, while another-potentially ignoring or rejecting those same influences-be concerned only with their immediate stimulation? Looking at Maslows hierarchy of needs suggests that we cannot move on to 'self actualization' without first attaining self esteem. Self esteem is impossible without love, meaning we have no motivation towards achievement- and acquiring the productive sills for making progress- unless we first acquire the sense of belonging that comes with love, friendship, and acceptance. Thus, many people grow up seeking low and approval that they are incapable of motivating themselves and taking on the responsibility and assurance of conquering a difficult field.</p>

<p>We may try to find excuses or reasons for our problems. Some may work such as an ADHD Diagnosis or discovering your Myers-Briggs personality types may be insightful to the way you work and why or why you are not productive. But overall you must defeat the demon which is the toxic internal critic that comes from having poor self esteem.</p>

<p><i>Only once we've grasped our own role in our dysfunctionality can we develop productive and organizational competencies.</i></p>

<p>Self Belief is the missing ingredient. The emotional roots of procrastination involve inner feelings of fears, hopes, memories, doubts, and pressures. The outcome is a series of mistaken all-or-nothing ideas such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything I do must go easily</li>
<br>
<li>I should have no limitations</li>
<br>
<li>If it is not right than it is not worth doing</li>
<br>
<li>There is a right answer and I am waiting to find it</li>
</ul>

<p>Other examples of how low-self-esteem shows itself is in the form of self-sabotage. If we belive we are not worthy of success then will adopt behaviours that prevent it. You must make strong efforts to raise your 'deserve level.</p>

<p>in regards to motivation and goals-Motivation is key! 'motivation ignites, energizes, determines, directs, and explains our behaviours." Tom Gorman from Motivation (2007) cites the enemies of motivation as feeling undeserving, fear, comparison, and blame. The solution is to make plans and goals that give us motivation and derail our negative beliefs (which often need to be navigated and accommodated)</p>

<p><b>Seven keys for goal setting:</b></p>

<ol>
<li> Goals should excite you. Many people set goals that are designed to please others. What excites your interest or even your anger?</li>
<br>
<li>Goals Should reflect your values. You need to look deeper than pure excitement which may dissipate as the going gets tough. Removing the motivating thrill of exctiment from your long term-goal-setting isn't easy. But it is possible with the aid of your values. What deep-rooted values do you hold?</li>
<br>
<li> Set specific goals. Goals need to be measurable. Too often our goals are vague- partly because our fear of disappointment has prevented us from thinking too hard about the specifics. 4. Visualize your goals. Detail is important when it comes to goals even if the details change as your progess. Such a vision shouldn't frustrate you, It should motivate you.</li>
<br>
<li>Develop milestones. Decide what must be accomplished within one year, two, five, ten... Each milestone needs clarity and detail-ensuring that, by the end of the exercise, we have clearly connected points along a path plotting the journey between your current status and ultimate destination. Such a path should also make the next step obvious.</li>
<br>
<li>  Write down your goals. They serve as the map.</li>
<br>
<li> Reward yourself.</li>
</ol>

<h3> Find your flow</h3>

<p>They key to exhileration is not the task itself- but the special state of mind called "flow. When our skills are fully engaged; when we're stretched and challenged but remain confident of progress; when we're concentrating so hard we are unaware of the distractions around us; and when we are nimbly moving between tasks or handling equipment with agility and dexterity.</p>

<p>Here's how to encourage flow:</p>

<p><b>Focus on (or find) your talents:</b> Flow doesn't emerge from the formalized work that your parents have forced upon you. It comes from what you are good at. Set challenging goals: While you should always focus on the immediate next steps, and concern yourself with achieving them, such steps must lead you somewhere you want to go. Flow comes from having direction- building your confidence step by step.</p>

<p><b>Reduce your leisure time:</b> Studies at the University of Chicago found that the most common emotional state recorded during leisure time was apathy. This is a dangerous state because it can quickly feel normal, meaning we cannot motivate ourselves to restart work.</p> 

<p><b>Kill destructive behaviour:</b> You must take responsibility of your mental and physical state and realize that neglect in one area feeds neglect elsewhere. Believe in self improvement-stating with better habits.</p> 

<p><b>Remove distractions and focus on just one task at a time:</b> Multi-tasking is the death of flow. Create a sense of urgency. This is an interesting one because most self-help literature talks about reducing stress. Of course, too much stress is counterproductive- but if you've set yourself time-based milestones to achieve your goals- you need to achieve them. Urgency matters. You've spent too much time in an unproductive state- while others have motored ahead. Well here is where you start catching up.
Record your progress. You have to sustain behaviour over long period, not just week even year! And the best way reinforce your progress to write it down. 

<p><b>We must follow logical process making decisions:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Establish the context of decision: what, excactly is decided? (This may not obvious if emotions are in the way.) Also, what is the key criteria evaluating decision (cost, speed, quality), as well as the critical factors that may dictate preferences (money, security...)</li>
<br>
<li>Frame the issue. important to confirmation bias deciding upon actual decision required. Furthermore, poorly framed questioned may end up with us making decisions aimed atdealing with the wrong issue, or even invented one that acts as surrogate for concerns. </li>
<br>
<li>Develop alternatives. Of course, we may have a bias for single alternatives and will spend time seeking confirmation that our 'gut instincts' are correct. Yet, gut instincts are based on poor conditioning which we have seen, can negatively distort perspectives. So we must develop a list of alternatives, even if this seems forced at first. </li>
<br>
<li>Evaluate alternatives. Indeed, many of invented alternatives may be baloney, so evaluation required. Which of choices most feasible? What will they cost terms time, money, resources? Is affordable? And is cost the criteria evaluation? Select the alternatives. This is difficult Again, reference to out long term goals that should support our judgement.</li>
<br>
<li>Select the best alternatives. This is the difficult bit. Again, a reference to our long term goals should support our judgement. </li>
</ol>
