# Awaken the Giant Within by Tony Robbins - Summary

## Chapter One: Dreams of Destiny - How to Create Lasting Change

1. Identify what you will no longer accept in your life (raise your standards).
2. Change your limiting beliefs. Believing you can change is crucial. Cultivate conviction.
3. Change your strategy. Find a role model—someone already achieving the results you seek. Knowing what to do isn't enough; you must take action!

**Master These Five Areas of Your Life:**

1. Emotional mastery
2. Physical mastery (health and energy are essential for enjoying life).
3. Relationship mastery (romantic, family, business, and social)
4. Financial mastery (focus on contribution, not just wealth).
5. Time mastery

## Chapter Two: Decisions: The Pathway to Power

We are shaped by our decisions and actions, not circumstances. Consistent actions shape our lives. The decisions you make daily determine how you feel today and who you become. Decide how you want to live in the future, and commit to those decisions. There's a difference between _interest_ and _commitment_. Empowerment comes from attaching commitment to our decisions.

_"If you don't set a baseline standard for what you'll accept in your life, you'll find it easy to slip into behaviors and attitudes or a quality of life that's far below what you deserve."_ Commitment begins with goals, direction, and standards. Maintain these standards, especially during tough times.

If you're dissatisfied, decide to change. You have the power to decide and commit. A single decision can immediately change your life. Decision leads to action. If you decide what you want, take action, learn, and adjust your approach, you'll build momentum.

**Robbins' Ultimate Success Formula:**

1. Decide what you want.
2. Take action.
3. Notice what's working and what's not.
4. Change your approach until you achieve your desired outcome.

A true decision means committing to a result and eliminating other possibilities. "Profound knowledge" is any simple distinction, strategy, belief, skill, or tool that can immediately improve our lives. This book aims to provide such knowledge.

**Three Decisions You Make Constantly That Control Your Destiny:**

1. What to focus on
2. What things mean to you
3. What to do to create desired results

It's not what happens to you, but your _decisions_ about focus, meaning, and action that determine your destiny. Many don't make these crucial decisions consciously, leading to "Niagara Syndrome"—passively going with the flow until it's too late.

Your brain has an internal decision-making system shaped by your core beliefs, values, references, habitual questions, and emotional states. You _can_ control this system. Mastery comes from good judgment, which often comes from bad judgment! Fast-track mastery by constantly trying and learning from failures.

To succeed:

1. Clearly decide what you're committed to achieving.
2. Take massive action.
3. Notice what works and what doesn't.
4. Change your approach until you succeed.

_"In order to succeed, you must have long-term focus... It's all the small decisions along the way that cause people to fail. It's failure to follow up. It's failure to take action. It's failure to persist. It's failure to control what we focus on. It's failure to manage our emotional states. Conversely, success is the result of deciding to contribute, deciding to feed your mind rather than allowing the environment and circumstances to control you."_

**Activity:**

Remember, your _decisions_, not your _conditions_, determine your destiny. Make one or two decisions you've been putting off, and take the first step toward achieving them.

## Chapter Three: The Force That Shapes Your Life

What you link pain to and what you link pleasure to shapes your destiny. Experiences create "neuro-associations" that affect future decisions. We must direct our own associations of pain and pleasure. What drives behavior is the instinctive reaction to pain and pleasure, not intellectual calculation. We can consciously link pain to undesirable behaviors and pleasure to empowering ones.

**Activity:**

1. Write down four actions you've been putting off.
2. For each action, answer: "Why haven't I taken action? What pain have I linked to this action?"
3. Write down what it will cost you if you don't change.
4. Write down all the pleasure you'll receive by taking these actions now.

## Chapter Four: Belief Systems: The Power to Create and Destroy

It's not our environment or events, but the _meaning_ we attach to them, that shapes us. Beliefs guide us toward pleasure and away from pain. Our brains constantly ask: "Will this mean pain or pleasure? What must I do to avoid pain and gain pleasure?"

Beliefs can be limiting generalizations about the past. How we handle adversity is crucial. Resilient people don't see problems as permanent, pervasive, or personal.

**How to Change a Belief:**

Associate pain with old beliefs. Challenge yourself with new experiences that question your beliefs. Differentiate between opinions, beliefs, and convictions. Reshape these to work for you. Conviction drives action. To create a conviction:

1. Start with a belief.
2. Reinforce it with powerful references.
3. Find or create a triggering event to prove it.

"Kaizen" (constant, never-ending improvement) is essential for success and happiness. Robbins' acronym is "CANI."

**Activity:**

Brainstorm all your beliefs, both empowering and disempowering. Include "if-then" beliefs and global beliefs. Circle your three most empowering beliefs and three most disempowering ones. For each disempowering belief, ask:

1. How is this belief ridiculous or absurd?
2. Was the person I learned this belief from a good role model?
3. What will it cost me if I don't let go of this belief?

Replace negative beliefs with positive ones. Ask yourself: "What would I have to believe to succeed here? What do successful people believe differently than I do? What is necessary for me to believe to succeed?" Remember, nothing has meaning except the meaning we give it.

## Chapter Five: Can Change Happen in an Instant?

Change _can_ happen quickly. It's about conditioning, not programming. Like a piano tuner, we must reinforce changes consistently. Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC) can condition your nervous system to associate pleasure with what you want and pain with what you need to avoid.

**Three Steps for Long-Term Change:**

1. Believe something _must_ change.
2. Believe _I_ must change it.
3. Believe _I can_ change it.

Change is like therapy—it often starts strong but fades. Consistency is key.

## Chapter Six: How to Change Anything: The Science of NAC

The six steps of NAC can be used for any challenge:

1. Ask: "What do I want to do instead?"
2. Get leverage on yourself. Realize the cost of _not_ changing.
3. Interrupt the pattern. Do something outrageous to break the cycle.
4. Create an empowering alternative. What will you do instead?
5. Condition the new pattern. Imagine and rehearse it with emotion and repetition.
6. Test it.

"Leverage" comes from recognizing the pain of not living up to your standards. Change requires more than knowledge; it requires deep emotional conviction.

## Chapter Seven: How to Get What You Really Want

Ask yourself what you truly want and _why_. You want things because they lead to desired feelings or states. Emotions are biochemical storms in our brains, which we can learn to control.

A "state" is the sum of our neurological processes at any moment. Many states are unconscious. Behavior is a result of our _state_, not our ability. Change your state to change your ability.

Emotion is created by motion. Exercise and good posture are important. Don't turn to destructive habits to change your state. Cultivate many ways to create resourceful states. Conscious control of your mind is essential. Success is living a life of pleasure and minimal pain. All you want is to change how you feel.

**Activity:**

List 20 things you can do to feel good. Plan for pleasure every day. "If you do not have a plan for pleasure, you will have pain!"

## Chapter Eight: Questions Are the Answer

Our questions determine our thoughts. Successful people ask better questions. Quality questions create a quality life.

_"The difference between people is the difference in the questions they ask consistently."_ Change your mental focus by asking new questions. Don't ask "Why me?" Ask "What do I still have? Who am I? What am I capable of? How can I use this to my advantage?"

_"Think of questions you habitually ask yourself in the area of finances. Invariably, if a person isn't doing well financially, it is because they're creating a great deal of fear in their life—fear that keeps them from investing or mastering their finances in the first place. You should ask, 'What plans do I need in order to achieve my ultimate (financial, relationship, health) goals?' These questions will help determine your focus, how you think, how you feel, and what you do."_

_"Remember it is not only the questions that you ask, but the questions that you fail to ask, that shape your destiny. People who want to lose weight might ask 'What is the sweetest food I can get away with?' instead of asking 'What is something healthy that will give me energy and feel good?'"_

**How Questions Work:**

- They immediately change what we are focusing on and therefore how we feel.
- They change what we delete.
- They change the resources available to us.

**Problem-Solving Questions:**

When faced with a problem, ask:

1.  What is great about this problem?
2.  What is not perfect yet?
3.  What am I willing to do to make it the way that I want it?
4.  What am I willing to no longer do in order to make it the way that I want?
5.  How can I enjoy the process while I do what is necessary to make it the way that I want?

**Activity:**

"Some of the most important questions we ask is 'What is my life really about? What am I really committed to?'" But don't get stuck in questioning. Action leads to results. Decide what's important, and take action. "What is one action that you could take immediately to instantly change the quality of your emotions and feelings each and every day of your life? Now go take action towards it."

## Chapter Twelve: The Magnificent Obsession—Creating a Compelling Future

The story of OJ Simpson's childhood struggle with rickets and his determination to break football records illustrates the power of goal setting. "Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible." It's as if your intensely emotional thoughts shape your existence. "The conception of your goal is the master plan that guides all thought."

**Activity:**

Regain confidence by recognizing past progress. Reflect on your progress over the past five years in various areas (physical, mental, emotional, attractiveness, relationships, living environment, social, spiritual, career, financial). Project yourself five years into the future in these areas. Remember that dissatisfaction can be a motivator.

**Making Your Dreams a Reality:**

1. Personal development goals
2. Career/business/economic goals
3. Toys/adventure goals
4. Contribution goals

Brainstorm: "What could I want from my life if I knew I could not fail?" Write down everything you'd want in each category. Create a timeline for action. Choose your most important goal for this year.

To make your goal real, rehearse and emotionally enjoy the experience of achieving it at least twice a day.

Goals are a means to an end. "Achieving goals by themselves will never make us happy in the long term; it's who you become, as you overcome the obstacles necessary to achieve your goals, that can give you the deepest and most long-lasting sense of fulfillment." Ask yourself: "What kind of person will I have to become in order to achieve all that I want?" List the character traits, skills, abilities, attitudes, and beliefs you'll need to develop.

## Chapter Thirteen: The Ten-Day Mental Challenge

Consistency is key. "The mark of a champion is consistency!" This book aims to improve your overall standard of living. "The same pattern of thinking that has gotten us to where we are will not get us to where we want to go."

**A Plan for Interrupting Old Patterns:**

1. Decide what you want.
2. Get leverage on yourself.
3. Interrupt the limiting pattern by going on a "Mental Diet."

For the next ten days, commit to taking full control of your mental and emotional faculties. Do not indulge in unresourceful thoughts or emotions. Focus on solutions, not problems.

## Chapter Fourteen: Ultimate Influence: Your Master System

"If someone is doing better than we are in any area of life, it's simply because they have a better way of evaluating what things mean and what they should do about it." The goal is to evaluate everything in a way that consistently guides you to make choices that produce desired results.

**Five Elements of Evaluation:**

1. Your mental and emotional state
2. The questions you ask
3. Your hierarchy of values
4. Your beliefs and rules
5. Your reference experiences

## Chapter Fifteen: Life Values

Ask yourself: "What is most important to me?" Order your values from highest to lowest. People go to greater lengths to avoid pain than to pursue pleasure. Pursue pleasure by fulfilling your values. Ask: "What do my values need to be in order to create my ultimate destiny, to be the best person I could possibly be, to have the largest impact in my lifetime?" Also ask: "What values should I eliminate from my list in order to achieve my ultimate destiny?" (Examples of values: health, intelligence, making a difference, love, family, fun, honesty, creativity, learning, money, freedom, contribution, etc.)

## Chapter Sixteen: Rules

Rules are shortcuts for our brains. They provide a sense of certainty. Our rules are the beliefs that determine when we experience pain or pleasure. Ask yourself: "What has to happen for me to feel good?" Often, we create rules from past experiences that are no longer appropriate. You could be "winning" but feel like you're losing because your scorecard is unfair. Create rules that empower you!

**Checklist for Empowering Rules:**

- Disempowering if impossible to meet.
- Disempowering if determined by something you cannot control.
- Disempowering if it gives you few ways to feel good and many ways to feel bad.

Set up a system of evaluation with achievable rules that make it easy to feel good and hard to feel bad. Engage in "Rule Re-alignment":

1. What does it take for you to feel successful?
2. What does it take for you to feel loved by others?
3. What does it take for you to feel confident?
4. What does it take for you to feel excellent in any area of your life?

## Chapter Seventeen: References

References are all the experiences you've recorded in your nervous system. Some are conscious, some unconscious. They are used to support beliefs. "We have enough references within us to back up any idea that we want." Consciously seek experiences that expand your sense of who you are and what you are capable of. "It is not our references, but our _interpretations_ of them, the way we organize them, that clearly determine our beliefs."

## Chapter Eighteen: Identity

"What we can or cannot do...is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are." Self-identity is the beliefs we use to define ourselves. Our sense of certainty about who we are creates boundaries and limits. Capability is constant, but how much you use depends on your identity.

Studies show students' capabilities are affected by the identities they develop as a result of teachers' beliefs. We act consistently with our views of who we are. The Pygmalion effect demonstrates the power of identity.

"If you don't know who you are, then how can you decide what to do?" One shift in identity can cause a shift in your entire master system.

**How Your Identity is Formed:**

Is your identity the result of conscious choices, or other people's opinions, events, and other factors? "Your identity is nothing but the decisions you've made about who you are, what you've decided to fuse yourself with. You become the labels you've given yourself. The way you define your identity defines your life."

**Understanding the Mid-Life Crisis:**

People who act inconsistently with their self-beliefs can experience an "identity crisis." If we have a broader sense of who we are, our identity is never threatened.

**Who Are You Anyway?**

"Remember, what you call your identity is simply what you've decided to identify with."

**The Power to Re-invent Yourself:**

1. List the elements of your ideal identity.
2. Consciously decide who you want to be.
3. Develop a plan of action consistent with your new identity.
4. Commit to your new identity and broadcast it, especially to yourself.

**The Future of Your Identity:**

Refine and expand your identity. Be aware of influences on your identity and take control of the process. Otherwise, you become a prisoner of your past.

# Part Three: The Seven Days to Shape Your Life

## Day One: Emotional Destiny

_Outcome:_ Take control of your consistent emotions and consciously reshape your daily experience. There is no true success without emotional success.

1. Write down the emotions you experience in an average week.
2. List the events or situations that trigger these emotions.
3. Develop an antidote for each negative emotion. Use the appropriate tools: Change your words? Change your beliefs? Ask new questions? Focus on solutions.

## Day Two: Physical Destiny

_Outcome:_ Condition your metabolism and muscles for desired energy and fitness levels. Make health and fitness part of your identity. Meditate and identify areas for improvement.

## Day Three: Relationship Destiny

_Outcome:_ Enhance the quality of your relationships by reviewing the six fundamentals:

1. Know the values and rules of the other person.
2. Focus on giving, not taking.
3. Identify and address warning signals.
4. Prioritize your relationships.
5. Focus on improvement, not just avoiding problems.
6. Reassociate to what you love about the other person.

**Activity:**

1. Discuss values and rules in your relationship.
2. Decide that being in love is more important than being right.
3. Develop a pattern interrupt for heated moments.
4. Communicate resistance with softness.
5. Plan regular date nights.

## Day Four: Financial Destiny

_Outcome:_ Take control of your financial future by learning the five foundational elements of wealth.

Mastery of money is possible once you understand the fundamentals. Use NAC to condition yourself for financial success. Many mistakenly believe money will solve all their problems. Financial freedom offers opportunities to expand, share, and create value.

Reasons for financial struggles:

1. Mixed associations with money (e.g., associating wealth with hard work at an unenjoyable job).
2. Perceived complexity of finances.
3. Belief in scarcity.

True wealth comes from "economic alchemy"—turning something of little value into something of greater value through technology.

**Five Fundamental Lessons for Creating Lasting Wealth:**

1. **Earn more income:** Increase your value by developing skills, knowledge, and creative thinking. Add value to people's lives.
2. **Maintain your wealth:** Spend less than you earn and invest the difference. Create a spending plan, not just a budget.
3. **Increase your wealth:** Invest and reinvest your returns for compound growth. Understand different investment types and your risk tolerance. Develop a clear investment plan.
4. **Protect your wealth:** (Legal information related to asset protection).
5. **Enjoy your wealth:** Practice tithing. True wealth is an emotion—a sense of abundance.

**Assignment:**

1. Examine your financial beliefs.
2. Add more value at work.
3. Commit to saving and investing 10%.
4. Get financial coaching.

## Day Five: Be Impeccable: Your Code of Conduct

_Outcome:_ Consistently live your values.

It's possible to have good values and aligned rules but not live them in the moment. We must ensure we consistently live our values.

**Activity:**

1. List the states you commit to experiencing daily.
2. Describe how you'll know you're experiencing each state.
3. Commit to experiencing these states daily. Create a "code of conduct" and review it often.

## Day Six: Master Your Time and Your Life

_Outcome:_ Use time to your advantage. Time is a mental construct. Our experience of time is the result of our mental focus.

**Three Time-Saving Tips:**

1. **Distort time:** Our beliefs filter our perception of time. Choose how to measure your time.
2. **Importance vs. Urgency:** Focus on important activities, not just urgent ones.
3. **Save yourself years:** Learn from others' experiences through modeling and reading.

## Day Seven: Rest and Play

_Outcome:_ Achieve balance. Plan a day of excitement.

## Conclusion

We have the power to control how we think, feel, and act. Small decisions create our destinies. Our actions communicate our values and beliefs. We control our internal world, which shapes our decisions and actions. By changing ourselves, we can influence others and create change in the world.
