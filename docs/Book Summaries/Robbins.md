<h1>Awaken the giant within By Tony Robbins<h1>

<h2>Chapter One: Dreams of Destiny<i>How to create lasting change</i></h2>

<ol>
<li> Write down all the thins you no longer accept in your life and will no longer tolerate (raise your standards)</li>

 <li> Change your limiting beliefs. You must believe you can changel Changing your belief system is central!! You need conviction.</li>

<li> Change your strategy. He suggests finding a role model. Someone who is already getting the results you are
looking for. Also knowing what to do is not enough, you must take action!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Creating lasting change continued Master these five areas of your life:</h3>


<ol>
<li> Emotional mastery</li>
<b>
<li> Physical mastery (We must have the health and energy to be able to enjoy life!)</li>
<b>
<li> Relationship mastery (romantic, family, business, and social) 4. Financial mastery (the key is not the mere pursuit of wealth, but changing your beliefs and attitudes about it so you see it as a means for contribution, not the end-all and be-all for happiness).</li>
<b>
<li> Time mastery.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Chapter Two: Decisions the pathway of power</h2>

<p>we are shaped by decisions and actions more so than by circumstances. In essence, if we want to direct our lives, we must take control of our consistent actions. It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. but what we do consistently (p.32). This is referred to as the power of decision. The decisions you make right now, every day, will shape how you feel today as well as who you are going to become. Therefore, if we choose to we can decide to make our lives an inspiring example. How? By simply making decisions today about how we are going to live in the future. But! It is not enough to decide we must commit to our decisions! There is a big difference between interested in something versus committing to it. We can only empower ourselves if we attach commitment to our decisions.</p>

<p><i>"If you don't set a baseline standard for what you'll accept in your life, you'll find it easy to slip into behaviours and attitudes or a quality of life that's far below what you deserve" and so commitment begins with goals in directions and necessary standards for yourself. And commit to them Always no matter if you are going through tough times. (p.35)</i></p>

<p>If you do not like how something is going then you must decide to change it. You have the power to decide and commit. You must know that you can make a decision right now that will immedietly change your life a decision about a habit you'll change or a skill that you'll master, or how you'll treat people, etc... (p.36); for example Ghandi simply first DECIDED to rid British Rule. Deciding to produce results causes events to be set in motion. If you simply decide what it is you want, get yourself to take action, learn from it, and change your approach, then you will create the momentum to achieve the result.</p>

<h3> Within Robbin's book 'unlimited power' he has the ultimate success formula:</h3>

<ol>
<li>decide what you want </li>
<b>
<li> Take action</li>
<b>
<li>notice what's working or not</li>
<b>
<li>change your approach until you achieve what you want (p.38)</li>
</ol>

<p>The word decision comes from the latin rroot 'de' from 'caedere' which means 'to cut' and so making a true decision means committing to achieving a result, and then cutting yourself off from any other possibility p.39</p>

<p>Dr. W. Edwards Deming calls profound knowledge which is any simple distinction, strategy, belief, or skill, or tool that, the minute we understand, we can apply it to make immediate increases in the quality of our lives. The purpose of this book is to create profound knowledge that has universal application to improving our personal and professional lives to empower people to improve their mental, emotional, physical, and financial destinies. (p.40)</p>

<p><b>There are three decisions that you make every moment of your life that control your destiny:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>What to focus on </li>
<b>
<li> What things mean to you</li>
<b>
<li> What to do to create the results you desire.</li>
</ul>

<p>You see, it's not what's happening to you now or what has happened in your past that determines you you become. Rather, it's your decisions about what to docus on, what things mean to you, and what you're going to do about them that will determine your ulimtate destiny. (p.40)</p>

<p>Too many of us do not make the majority of our decisions consciously, especially these three absolute crucial ones. I call this Niagara Syndrome, that life is a river and in a short time people get caught up in the current; current events, current challenges, and if they do not paddle consciously they merely 'go with the flow. They remain uncosunscios until one day it's too late and they take a fall. (p.41).</p>

<p>Although you do not notice it, your brain has already constructed an internal system for making decisions. It has been installed by your peers, parents, education, pereptions. (WhichHe gets into it later in the book). </p>

<ol>
<li>Your core beliefs</li>
<br>
<li> Your life values</li>
<br>
<li> Your references</li>
<br>
<li>The habitual questions that you ask yourself</li>
<br>
<li>The emotional states you experience in each moment.</li>

</ol>

<p>The synergy of these five elements determines what you do, don't do, and why. In this book he will guide you through your Master System. Know that you do not have to allow the programming of your past to control our present and future (p.42). He talks about how Mastery and Success comes from good judgment. Good judgment is the result of
experience, and experience is often the result of bad judgment! He explains how he fast tracked mastery by constantly trying, and failing in public speaking. (p.43) "One of the most important decisions you can make to ensure your long-term happiness is to decide to usewhatever life gives you in the moment. The truth of the matter is that there's nothing you can't accomplish if:</p>

<ul>
<li> You clearly decide what is that you are absolutely committed to achieving</li>
<br>
<li> You are willing to take on massive action</li>
<br>
<li>  You notice what's working and what is not 4. You continue to change your approach until you achieve what you want, using whatever life gives you along the way.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>"In order to succeed you must have long-term focus... It's all the small decisions along the way that cause people to fail. It's failure to follow up. It's failure to take action. It's failure to persist. It's failure to control what we focus on. It's failure to manage our emotional states. Conversely, success is the result of deciding to contribute to, deciding to feed your mind rather than allowing the environment and circumstances to control you (p.46)."</i></p>

<h3> p.51 Activity </h3>

<p>Know it is your decisions not your conditions that determine your destiny.</p>

<p>Make one or two decisions that you've been putting off. Then, take the first action towards achieving that goal!</p>

<h2>Chapter Three: The force that shapes your life</h2>

<p>What you link pain to and what you link pleasure to shapes your destiny What are some the experiences of pain and pleasure that have shaped your life? Basically the idea that experiences (good or bad) can create 'neuro-associations where an experience affects the nervous system, and then shapes future decisions. For me for example: T.R fire, wrong way driver. Or my negative/painful associations of social situations and pain we must direct our own associations of pain and pleasure otherwise we are no better than animals! He talks about how ridiculous it is in advertising that they make correlations in ads like MJ to Pepsi or sex to jeans. It is the same way we can shape our own actions. Linking feelings to sensations. What drives our behaviour is instinctive reaction to pain and pleasure, not intellectual calculation. And so he gives examples of linking the pain of obesity to delicious foods, is enough congitiively to shape our perception of something that feels good to pain, that shapes our behaviour. We can do this with everything!</p>


<h3>Activity Two (p.71) </h3>
<ol>

<li>Write down four actions that you need to take that you've been putting off</li>
<br>
<li>Under each of these actions, write down the answer to the following question: why haven't I taken action? In the past, what pain have I linked to this action?</li>
<br>
<li>Write down what it will cost you if you don't change now</li>
<br>
<li>Write down all the pleasure you will receive by taking each of these actions right now.</li>

<h2> Chapter Four: Belief systems: the power to create and the power to destroy</h2>

<p>He gives an example of a story where twin boys are born to a alcoholic felon father. One boy becomes an alcoholic and a felon while the other son becomes very successful and happy. When they asked each boy why has your life turned out this way?" they both answered: 'what else could I have become growing up with a father like that?</p>

<p>You see, it is never the environment, nor the events in our lives but rather the meaning we attatch to the events in our lives- how we interpret them- that shapes who we are today and who we will become tomorrow(p.74). What are beliefs designed for? They are the guiding force that tells us what will lead pain and what will lead to pleasure. Whenever something happens in your life, your brain asks two questions: 1) will this mean pain or pleasure. 2) What must I do now to avoid pain and/or gain pleasure?</p>

<p>"The challenge with all these beliefs is that they come limitations for future decisions about who you rae and what you are capable of. We need to remember who you are and what you are capable of. We need to remember the most of our beliefs are generalizations about our past, based on our interpretations of painful and pleasurable experiences. (p.75).</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges in anyone's life is knowing how to interpret failures. "How we deal with adversity and challenges will shape our lives more than almost anything else."</p>

<p>Knowing that how we deal with adversity is key.. Studies on permanence, pervasiveness, personal point to what make the resilient and successful just that. </p>

<ol>
<li>Acheivers never see a problem permanent </li>
<br>
<li>Those who are optimists see the pervasiveness of a problem. Pessimists see themselves as the problem and developed learned helplessness</li>
<br>
<li>Problems becoming personal is when we no longer see the problem or failure as a challenge to modify our approach, but rather a problem within ourselves, as a personality defect, we will immedietly feel overwhelmed. DO NOT MAKE PROBLEMS PERSONAL!</li>

<h3>How To Change A Belief </h3>

<p>All personal breakthroughs begin with a change in beliefs. if we associate pain to our old beliefs we can change our toxic old beliefs. There is usually doubt within old beliefs that you conjured up long ago that you may find you are embarrassed to consistently defend He tells us to challenge ourselves and engage in new experiences that causes us to question our beliefs and make new ones</p>


<p>He differentiates between opinions beliefs convictions (p 87). Recgonizing and re-shaping these opinions, beliefs, and convictions so that they work for you is a key to success.</p>

<p><i>"Often the best thing you can do to create mastery in any area of your life is to raise a belief to the level of conviction. Remember, conviction has the power to drive you to action, to push you through all kinds of obsacles (ex: viktor frankl) So how can you create a conviction? 1) Start with a basic belief. 2) reinforce your belief by adding new and more powerful resource references. 3) then find a triggering event or create your own to prove your convictions (example: that you CAN quite smoking).</i></p>

<p>One of the biggest takeways and underlying premises of this book is that in order to succeed and be happy. we've got to be constantly improving the quality of our lives, constantly growing and expanding. He gives the example of the Japanese term 'Kaizen' meaning constant never ending improvement. He then gives his own acronym: 'CANI' standing for constant and never ending improvement. (p.96).</p>

<h3> Activity #3 Small Improvements Are Beliebale And Therefore Acheivable! (Activity p.97-98)</h3>

<p>Brainstorm all the beliefs that you have, both that empower you and disempower you: little beliefs that don't seem to matter at all and global beliefs that seem to make a big difference. Make sure you cover:</p>

<p>If-Then beliefs like, <i>"if I consistently give my all, then I will succeed Global Beliefs, like beliefs about people- 'people are bad. And beliefs about yourself, about time, scarcity and abundance.</p>

<p>Next, take a moment to circle the three most empowering beliefs on your list. How do they empower you? How do they disempower you? Then ask yourself:</p>

<ul>

<li>How is this belief ridiculous or absurd?</li>
<br>
<li> Was the person I learned this belief from worth modeling in this area? 3. What will it ultimately cost me emotionally I don't let go of this belief? (physically, financially, relationships,loved ones)</li>
<br>
<li>Now replace your old negative patterns of beliefs with new positive ones. Write down replacement beliefs. If you are not getting the results you want in life I suggest you ask yourself what would I have to believe in order to succeed here? Or Who is already succeeding in this area, and what do they believe differently than I do about what s possible? Or 'what is necessary that I believe in order to succeed? (p.103). Remember that nothing in life has meaning except for the meaning that we give to it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter Five: Can change happen in an instant?</h2>

<p>He argues ppl can change very fast. Change doesn't have to be a long arduous process. All changes are created in a moment. He used NLP but is really conditioning' not programming people to help change THEMSELVES He gives the story of the piano tuner who does not just tune the piano once but instead must tune the piano  often and consistently so that the paino stays sharp. "This is exactly what we have to do if we're going to succeed in creating long-term change. Once we effect a change, we should reinforce it immedietly. Then we have to condition our nervous systems to succeed not just once, but consistently (p.112)"</p>

<p>
His NLP conditioning is called NAC (science of neuro-associative conditioning)- it is a step by step process that can condition your nervous system to associate pleasure to those things that you want to continuously movetowards and pain to those things you need to avoid in order to succeed consistently in your life without constant willpower or effort (p.112).</p>

<p>There are Three steps we must take to make long-term change and become our own conselors (p.114) 1. We must believe that something must change (ex: we know procrastinating is bad but do we take efforts toend it?</p>

<p> we must not only believe that things must change, but we must believe that I must change it (we must see ourselves as the source of change) 3. We must believe that / CAN change it. (we must believe that change is possible.)</p>

<p>ote* he then talks about how change is must like a form of therapy that usually starts off strong then fades away. This part is much like the power of habit or miracle morning except that he argues that we must stay consistent until we link the positive outcomes to our nervous system. 122 TLDR like when we touch fire and burn our hand immediately wel In our brain every time we repeat that the connection and the lesson Strengthens The next section is the six steps NAC to help you interrupt your disempowering patterns.</p>

<h2> Chapter six: How to change anything in your life: The science of neuro-associative conditioning</h2>

<p>The six steps of <u>NAC</u> can be used for anything challenges with relationships, problems in business. Use these six steps to disempower your negative patterns:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask yourself: "what do I want to do instead of worry?</li>
<br>
<li>Get leverage on yourself and realize what worry does to destroy your life. Bring it to a threshold; see what it would cost your ultimately in your life so that you're not willing to to pay that price anymore. Imagine the joy of getting this monkey off your back and living truly free for once and for all! </li>
<br>
<li> Interrupt this pattern! Every time you worry, break the pattern by being totally outrageous. </li>
<br>
<li>Create an empowering alternative. What will you do instead of worry? Pull our your journal and write downa plan of what you can do immediately instead. Maybe go for a run?</li>
<br>
<li>Condition the new pattern: vividly Imagine and rehearse this new pattern with tremendous emotional intensity and repetition until this new thought, behaviour or emotional pattern is automatic. Reinforce yourself by taking the first step: see yourself succeeding again and again. </li>
<br>
<li>Test it and see if it works.</li>
</ol>

<p>Robbins then talks about "leverage in the chapter. He is referring to the action of creating leverage for yourself by recognizing pain that is within you (not from external sources) knowing that you have not lived up to your own standards and full potential. Leverage is absolutely critical when creating any change. Change requires more than just establishing the knowledge that you should change but also the having the deepest emotional and sensory level knowing that you should change. Many of us are walking contradicitions and so we must use the pressure built up within ourselves to create the necessary change we wish to see to live up to our standards.</p>

<h2>Chapter Seven: How to get what you really want</h2>

<p>What do you want? Ask yourself what you truly want in life. Do you want a loving marriage, plenty of money, a thriving business, a house on a hill, to travel around the world..? whatever you desire you should ask yourself why do I want these things? What it all comes down to is the fact that you want these things or results because you see them as a means to achieve certain feelings, emotions, or states that you desire. When someone kisses you, what makes you feel good in that moment? Is it wet tissue touching your lips? Of course not! If that was a true a dog's kiss would suffice. All of our emotions are nothing but a flurry biochemical storm in our brains- and we can spark them at any moment. But we must first learn how to take control of them consciously instead of living in reaction.</p>

<p>A state can be defined as the sum of millions of neurological processes happening within us- the sum total of our total experience at any moment in time. Most of our states happen without any conscious direction on our part. We see something, and we respond to it by going into a state. It may be a resourceful and useful state, or an unresourcesful and limiting state, but there's not much that most of us do to control it.</p>

<p>If you have ever been in a situation that you are unable to recall someone's name or you feel anti-social or make a stupid move; this is not because you are anti-social and stupid but rather a result of the state that you are in at the given moment. Therefore, your behaviour is not the result of your ability, but rather, of the state that you are in at the moment. To change your ability, you must change your state. To open up a multitude of resources that lie within you, put yourself in a state of resourcefulness and active expectancy- and watch miracles happen!</p>

<p>So how can we change our emotional states? Think of your states as operating a television. In order to have a
clear screen with vivid colour you must "plug in and turn on. Turning on your physiology is like giving the set
the electricity that it needs to operate.</p>

<P>Robbins argues that 'emation is created by motion' thus he says we must exercise every morning and work at getting a good posture. Interestingly enough May 2017 edition of menshealth magazine made some good areas to focus on improving your physiology (plus some): -do back extension workouts (to work on a particularly vulnerable part of the back) -we sit a lot so work on your hamstrings: do leg curls. But also do yoga.</p>

<p>We can change our state in so many ways but often times people turn to alcohol, mindless entertainment, and food. Instead we must change our states in ways that empower us! The key in life is to have so many ways that direct your life that it becomes an art of staying in a focused, optimistic, productive states. When we stay in sedentary states of comfort we become like a frog in a boiling pot of water slowly warming up (that he doesn't notice, but not heated quickly enough that he jumps out) or like the unconscious person floating down the river towards the falls. You must get yourself in consciousness, mindful, and determined states in order to succeed.</p>

<p>You've got to realize that you must take conscious control of running your own mind. You've got to do it deliberately; otherwise, you're going to be at the mercy of whatever happens around you. You must be able to take control of your own states. My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel
tons of pleasure and very little pain. So what you need to remember from this chapter is all that you want in life to change how you feel.</p>

<h3> Activity #4: make a list of things you can do to make yourself feel good! Try to list 20 things</h3>

<p>If you do not have a plan for pleasure, you will have pain! The whole key thing here is to create a huge list of ways to make yourself feel good so you don't need to turn to those other ways that are destructive. If you link pain to the destructive habits and pleasure to the empowering activities you will find that most of them are accessible throughout the day! Then develop a plan for pleasure for every day! Do not just hope that pleasure will randomly show up. Make room for it!</p>

<h2>Chapter eight: Questions are the answer.</h2>

<p>Our questions determine our thoughts. "successful people asked better questions, and as a result, they got better answer. Quality questions create a quality life. Questions set off a processional effect that has an impact beyond our imagination. I believe all human progress is preceded by new questions."</p>

<p>"The difference between people the difference in the questions they ask consistently. Some people are depressed on a regular basis because they have a limited state of focusing and evaluation. These people can change in an instant by just changing their mental focus. The quickest way to do this is by asking new questions.... Lots of people ask questions like "why would god do this to me and can create a difference in their lives by changing their questions such as: what do I still have? Who am I really? What am I capable of now more than ever before? How can I use my current situation to my advantage?</p>

<p>"Think of questions you habitually ask yourself in the rea of finances. Invariably, if a person isn't doing well financially, it is because they're creating a great deal of fear in their life-fear that keeps them from investing or mastering their finances in the first place. You should ask what plans do I need in order to achieve my ultimate (financial, relationship, health) goals? These questions will help determine your focus, how you think, how you feel, and what you do."(p.183)</p>

<p>"Remember it is not only the questions that you ask, but the questions that you fail to ask, that shape your destiny. People who want to lose weight might ask what is the sweetest food I can get away with' instead of asking what is something healthy that will give me energy and feel good?"</p>

<p>How Questions Work:</p>

<ul>
<li> They immediately change what we are focusing on and therefore how we fell. (learning how to askempowering questions is a critical skill, Questions can even change our 'state' such as by asking what is great about my life right now?'")</li>

<li> Questions change what we delete. Humans can delete things from their memories while also focus intensely on other things and change this process at times Questions are the laser of the human consciousness. They concentrate our focus and determine what we feel and do. Furthermore, questions have the power to affect our beliefs and what we consider to be possible or impossible. The knowledge that we take for granted is called "presuppositions and they program us to accept things that may not necessarily be true. Do not fall into the trap of disempowering presuppositions and instead create questions to challenge these beliefs, question
legitimacy, and create references and experiences to back up your empowering beliefs.</li>

<li>Questions change the resources available to us... You and I have the same power at our disposal. At any
moment, the questions that we ask ourselves can shape our perceptions of who we are, what we are capable
of and what we are willing to do to achieve our dreams (p. 191).</li>
</ul>

<b>Problem Solving Questions</b>

<p>The key is to ask questions that empower you. So when you have questions like "why don't I have any time?" or "Why can't I excel in this area?"<p>

<uL>
<li>What is great about this problem? (think contextually. Good fortune or a unique circumstance is probably the only reason that allows you to be asking yourself such disempowing questions to the roadblocks in your life)</li>
<br>

<li> What is not perfect yet? (this question will give you new questions and direction. For example: perhaps your scheduling and planning can use some fine tuning).</li>
<br>
<li> What am I willing to do to make it the way that I want it? (perhaps you are willing to hire a tutor to get better grades or hire a cleaner at your house to afford yourself more time with family)</li>
<br>
<li>What am I willing to no longer do in order to make it the way that I want? (ex: sleep in late) S. How can I enjoy the process while I do what is necessary to make it the way that I want? (How can you enjoy the process of change? Perhaps you must commute, play video games! Perhaps you need to talk to someone, do it in a hot-tub!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Activity #6 </h3>

<p>Some of the most important questions we ask is "what is my life really about? What am I really committed to?" but if you wait to get the perfect answer, you are going to be in deep trouble. There is a point in your life when you must stop asking questions in order to make progress and stop evaluating and start doing. Through action can you only produce more certain results. When you decide what is important to you, at least in the moment, use your personal power to begin to follow through with action. So now ask yourself, what is one action that you could take immedietly to instantly change the quality of your emotions and feelings each and every day of your life. Now go take action towards it<p>

<h2> Chapter Nine: The vocabulary of ultimate success </h2>

<p>Section to be revisted </p>

<h2>Chapter ten: Destroy the blocks, break down the wall, let go of the rope, and dance your way to success: the
power of metaphors</h2>

<h2>Chapter eleven: The ten emotions of power</h2>

<h2>Chapter twelve: the magnificent obsession-creating a compelling future</h2>

<p>The story of OJ simpson having Rickets as a kid an unable to walk without an aid and yet telling his football hero that his goal was to break all of his football records. Setting goals is the first step in tunring te invisible into the visible. the foundation for all success in life. It's as if infinite intelligence will fill any mold you create using the impression of your intensely emotional thoughts. In other words, you can chisel your own existence by the thoughts you consistently project every moment of your life. The conception of your goals is the master plan that guides all of your thouhgts. The conception of your goal is the master plan that guides all thought.</p>

<h3> Activity #7 </h3>


<p>Robbins encourages us to regain our confidence by recganizing that things are not getting worse, nor at the stagnating. Think about the progress you have made in the past 5 years in the following areas of your life: (physically, mentally, emotionally, attractiveness, relationships, living environment, socially, spiritually, career, financially). Then project yourself where you would like to be in those areas 5 years from now. (remember that dissatisfaction can be a major key to success). (he then talks about the importance of 'eustress to motivate us in productive directions).</p>


<p>Now let us take the first steps in making your dreams reality. We will cover four areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>personal development goals </li>
<li>career/business/ economic goals</li>

<li>Toys/adventure goals </li>
<li>Contribution goals</li>

<p>On a piece of paper brainstorm what could I want from my life if I knew I could not fail? Then for each category write down everything you'd want in each area of your life. Then quickly brainstorm a a timeline of action for each of those. Lastly, Choose your most important goal for this year.</P>

<p>To make your goal real you must; at least twice a day, rehearse and emotionally enjoy the experience of
achieving each one of those valued goals. </p>

<p>The purpose of the goal: we think that achieving the goal is the end. But if we had a greater understanding we'd realize that often in the pursuit of our goals, we set in motion processional effects that have consequences even more far reaching than we ever intended... Goals are a means to an end, not the ultimate purpose of our lives. They are simply a tool to concentrate our focus and move us in a dirction. The only reason we really pursue a goal is to cause ourselves to expand and grow. Achieving goals by themselves will never make us happy in the long term, it's who you become, as you overcome the obstacles necessary to achieve your goals, that you can give you the deepest and most long-lasting sense of fulfilment. So maybe the key question you need to ask if "what kind of person will I have to become in order to achieve all that I want? This d may be the most important question we can ask ourselves, for its answer will determine the direction you need to head personally. Please take a moment to write down all the character traits, skills, abilities, attitudes, beliefs, that you would need develop in order to achieve all of the goals you've written down previously</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirteen: The ten-day mental challenge</h2>

<p>Consistency, isn't that what we are all after? We do not just want to create results once in a while. We don't
want to be at our best once in a while. The mark of a champion is consistency! This book is not designed to make you reach a few realizations but rather attain an improved standard of living overall. In order for us to take our lives to the next level, we must realize that the same pattern of thinking that has gotten us to where we are will not get us to where we want to go.</p>

<p>So let me offer you a simple plan for interrupting your old patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving, a way
that can help you condition these new, empowering alternatives and make them absolutely consistent.</p>

<p><b>To break negative patterns we must implement the steps of NAC learned in chapter:</b> <p> 

<ol>
<li>You need to decide what you want.</li>
<br>

<li>You've got leverage on yourself. If you read this book and don't develop any new ways of thinking of new
habits then you HAVEN'T got leverage on yourself. Let your desires to aviud pain and introduce pleasure drive you to make the necessary changes to take your life to the next level.</li>
<br>
<li>Interrupt the limiting pattern by going on a Mental Diet to eliminate the negative and destructive patterns of thinking and feeling that inevitably come from living life in an emotionally reactionary and mentally undisciplined fashion. To begin your mental diet for the next ten days commit to taking full control of all your mental and emotional faculties by deciding right now that you will not indulge in or dwell on any unresourceful thoughts or emotions for ten consecutive days. Make certain that you focus on solutions not problems.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Part Two: Taking Control-The Master System. </h1> <p>The Second section of the book is dedicated to assisting you in taking direct control of your Master System of Evaluation- the force that controls the way you feel and what you do every moment of your life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14: ultimate influence: your master system</h2>

<p>The general idea in this chapter is that "if someone is doing better than we are in any area of life it's simply because they have a better way of evaluating what things mean and what they should do about it. The goal then is to be able to evaluate everything in your life in a way that consistently guides you to make choices that produce the results you desire.</p>

<p><b>Here is a brief overview of the five elements of evaluation:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>The first element that affects all of your evaluations is the mental and emotional state you are in while making an evaluation.</li>
<br>
<li>The second building block of our master system is the questions that we ask</li>
<br>
<li>The third element that affects your evaluations is your hierarchy of values. You must evaluate what brings you pleasure and what brings you pain (usually a regret of some type). The values that you select will shape every decision you make in your life.</li>
<br>
<li> 4. The fourth element is beliefs. Our beiefs give us a sense of certainty about how to feel and what to expect
from others, ourselves, life, and from people. Our rules are the beliefs we have about what has happened to
us for us to feel that our values have been met. Our beliefs determine our expectations and often control what
we're even willing to evaluate in the first place.</li>
<br>
<li> The fifth element of your master system is the hodgepodge of reference experiences. Within your brain you have stored everything you've experienced in your life and these references form the raw material that we use to construct our beliefs and guide our decisions. In order to decide what something means to us, we have t compare it to something sometimes we might compare what you have to what others have for example...but the references that you choose to look at will determine the meaning you take from any experience and will influence your beliefs and your actions.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Note* chapters 15-18 go through these elements directly and indirectly. I will do a brief summary of what I
personally have taken away from the chapters.</i></p>

<h2>Ch. 15: Life values</h2>

<p>Brainstorm the question: What is most important to me?" and then put those values in order from highest to lowest. Remember that people go to greater lengths to avoid pain than pursue pleasure. You must pursue pleasure by fulfilling your values. Ask yourself "what do my values need to be in order to create my ultimate destiny, in order to be the best person I could possibly be, in order to have the largest impact in my lifetime?" and ask "what values should I eliminate from my list in order to achieve my ultimate destiny?" (ex: of values: health, intelligence, making a difference, love, family, fun, honesty, creativity, learning, money, freedom, contribution, etc)</p>

<h2>Ch. 16: Rules </h2>

<p>Rules are a shortcut for our brain. They help us have a sense of certainty about our abilities and the consequences of our actions; thus they enable us to make lightning quick uncnonscious decisions about what we do, how we think, and our capabilities. Our rules are the beliefs that determine when we get pain or pleasure. Ask yourself What has to happen for you to feel good?" the truth is that nothing needs to happen for us to feel good but a lot of us tell ourselves that we cannot be happy until we are rich, or we cannot get that man/woman until we have 0% body fat, or that we cannot begin enjoying our lives until we fix a particular problem. And so these rules are the trigger that cause us pain or pleasure in our lives. (I realize that I have a rule that I cannot be successful, likeable, or enjoy my life until I am completely flourishing in the real of mental health). Often times we create rules from past experiences and then hold onto those rules for the rest of our lives; and then the rules that guide you life today may not be appropriate any longer for the person you have become. And so you could be winning and feel like you are losing because the scorecard you have created for yourself is unfair." You must create rules that empower you!</p>

<p><b> Here is a checklist to see if rules empower or disempower you.</b></p>

<ol>
<li> It's disempowering If it is impossible to meet. 
<li>It's disempowering if something you cannot control determines whether your rule has been met or not.

<li>It's disempowering if it gives you only a few ways to feel good and lots of ways to make you feel bad.
So the solution is simple, all we have to do to make our lives work is set up a system of evaluating that includes rules that are achievable, that make it easy t feel good and hard to feel bad, that constantly pull us in the direction that we want to go. Sometmimes we when rules seem paradoxical a reality we face in work, life, relationships, etc.. we should re-evaluate our rules in relation to our values and engage in "Rule Re-alignment": 
<ul>
<li> What does it take for your to feel successful? (Include answers like I must and I must never...)

<li> What does it take for you to feel loved by others? 3. What does it take for you to feel confident?

<li> What does it take for your to feel you are excellent in any areas of your life?
</ul>
</ol>

<h2> Chapter 17: References </h2>

<p>References are all the experiences of your life that you've recorded within your nervous system- everything you've ever seen, heard, touched, tasted, or smelled-stored away in your filing cabinet of your brain. Some references are picked up consciously, and some unconsciously and are then used to support beliefs; which we learned is nothing but a feeling of certainty about what something means....We have enough references within us to back up any idea that we want: the key is to expand the references that are available within your life. Consciously seek out experiences that expand your sense of who you are and what you are capable of, as well as organize your references in empowering ways. Furthermore, it is not our references, but our interpretations of them, the way we organize them-that clearly determine our beliefs."<p>

<h2> Chapter.18: Identity </h2>

<p>What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. it is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are. We often tell ourselves that we can or cannot do something. This is an example of our idea of our self identity. So what exactly is self identity? It is simply the beliefs that we use to define our own individuality, what makes us unique-good, bad, or indifferent from other individuals. And our sense of certainty about who we are creates the boundaries and limits within which we live. Your capability is constant, but how much of it you use depends upon the identity you have for yourself. For example, if you feel like you are a sociable outgoing person you will tap the resources of the behaviour that match your identity.</p>

<p>Research has shown that students' capabilities are powerfully impacted by the identities they develop for themselves as the result of teachers beliefs in their level of intelligence.</p>

<p>We act consistently with our views of who we truly are, whether that view is accurate or not. The reason is that one of the strongest forces in the human organism is the need for consistency. Just like there is reward for maintaining consistency, there is also the converse effect (the Pygmalion effect) for example, if you feel for certain that you are learning disabled is becomes a self fulfilling prophecy..</p>

<p>If you don't know who you are, then how can you decide what to do? How can you formulate values, adopt
beliefs, or establish rules? How can you judge whether something is good, bad, or indifferent? In fact, one
shift in identity can cause a shift of your entire master system. You can attain a new system of evaluation-the
states you will experience, the questions you will ask, the values that guide your actions, and the references
you organize into beliefs.</p>

<h3>How your identity is formed</h3>

<p>Did you consciously choose your identity, or is it the result of what other people have told you, significant events in your life and other factors that occurred without your awareness or approval? What consistent behaviours have you adopted that now help to form the basis of your identity? Studies show that people who viewed themselves as 'selfish' when made to commit a few small acts of non-selfishness could showball the acts to make acts of non-selfish volunteer work be 'of character for these individuals. There is leverage in shaping identity through action. "note however, that your identity is not limited by your experiences, but by your interpretation of your experiences. Your identity is nothing but the decisions you've made about who you are, what you've decided to fuse yourself with. You become the labels you've given yourself. The way you define your identity defines your life.</p>

<h3>Understanding the mid-life crisis</h3>

<p>people who act inconsistently with who they believe they are set the stage for the societal cliché of an identity crisis'. This often happens to people who consider themselves to be 'young and exciting but when they start getting grey hairs they do things to prove that they are still young like buying a fast car. But if we had a broader sense of who we are, our identity never becomes threatened. It doesn't take a crisis for most of us to understand that we can change our behaviours, but the prospect of changing our identity seems threatning or impossible to most.</p>

<h3>Who are you anways?</h3>

<p>Take a moment to identify who you are. Who are you? We can describe our traits, our relations, our ideas of ourselves, our spiritual beliefs, our accomplishments, our profession. The identity that our friends and peers
have of us also tend to affect us as well.</p>

 <p>Try this activity by answering these questions:</p>


<ul>
<li> If you were to look in the dictionary under your name what would it say?</li> 
<li> If you were to create an ID card that would represent who you are, what would be on it- and what would you leave off of it? "remember what you call your identity is simply what you've decided to identify with. The power to re-invent yourself</li> 

<li>Make a list of all the elements of your identity you want to have. Think maybe of some people that you look up to that have these traits and charateristics.</li>

<p>If you'd truly like to expand your identity and your life, then right now, consciously decide who you want to
be. Get excited and describe who you you have decided to become today. 3. Now develop a plan of action you could take that would cause you to know that you're truly living consistently with your new identity. In developing this plan, pay special attention to the friends you're choosing to spend time with. Will they reinforce or destroy the identity you are creating</p>

<li> The final step is to commit to your new identity by broadcasting it to everyone around you. The most important person to broadcast it to is yourself.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The future of your identity</h3>

<p>Even after completing this exercise, you'll want to continue to refine you identity, expand it, or create better rules for it. We live in a dynamic wourld where our identities must continually expand in order to enjoy a greater quality of life. You need become aware of things that may influence your identity, notice whether they are empowering or disempowering you, and take control of the whole process. Otherwise you become a prisoner of your own past.<p

<h1> Part Three: The seven days to shape your life </h1>

<h2> Day one: emotional destiny</h2> 

<p>Your outcome: take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life. There is no true success without emotional success.

<ul>
<li>Write down all the emotions you experience in an average week</li>

<li>List the events or situations you use to trigger these emotions 3. Come up with an antidote for each negative emotion, and employ one of the appropriate tools for responding to the action signal. DO you need to change the words you use to describe this experience? Do you need to change what you believe about this emotional state? Do you need to ask yourself new questions? Be sure to consistently focus on solutions instead of problems./li>
</ul>

<h2>Day two: Physical destiny</h2>

<p>Your outcome: Just as you've learned to condition your nervous system to produce the behaviours that will give you the results you want, the physical destiny you experience depends on how you condition your metabolism and muscles to produce the levels of energy and fitness you desire. My takeway: make health as well as fitness apart of your identity. Meditate and pin-point the areas that you are not as healthy or fit as you would like to be and make the necessary efforts to improve.</p>

<h2>Day three: Relationship destiny</h2>

<p>Your outcome: measurably enhance the quality of your personal relationships, and deepen your emotional connection with the people you care about by reviewing the six fundamentals of successful relationships.</p>

<p><b>Six key points that are valuable to any relationship:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>
<li>If you don't know the values and rules of the people with whom you share a relationship you should for pain. Know what the other persons 'rules' are for the relationship. </li>

<li> Some of the biggest challenges in relationships come from the fact that most people enter a relationship in order to get something: they're trying to find someone who's going to make them feel good. In reality, the only way a relationship will last is if you see your relationship as a place you go to give, and not a place that you go to take.</li>

<li> Like anything else in life, in order for a relationship to be nurtured there are certain things to look for and to look out for. There are certain warning signals within your relationship that can glag you that you need to tackle a problem immedietly. Before it gets out of hand. By identifying them, we can immediately intervene and eliminate problems before they balloon into destructive patterns that threaten the relationship itself. 4. Make your relationship one of the highest priorities in your life; otherwise they will take a back seat to any or all of the other things that are more urgent that happen during your day. Gradually, the level of emotional intensity and passion will drift away. We do not want to lose the power of our relationships simply because we got caught up in the law of familiarity, or we let neglect habituate us to the intense excitement and passion we have for a person.</li>

<li> Focus each day on how o make the relationship better (as opposed to focusing on how to avoid letting it fall apart). A corollary to this principle is that if you want your relationship to last, never ever threaten the relationship itself. In other words; don't ever say "if you do that, then I'm leaving" it creates destabilizing fear in both partners.</li>

<li>Each day, reassociate to what you love about this person you're in a relationship with. Reinforce your feelings of connection and renew your feelings of intimacy and attraction. Consistenly ask how did I get so lucky to have you in my life?" become fully associated to the priveledge of sharing your life with this person.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Activity</h3>

<ul>
<li>Talk to your SO and find what is most important to each of you in a relationship. What are your highest values in a relationship together? What has to happen for you to feel like those values are being fulfilled? </li>

<li> Decide that it is more important for your to be in love than to be right. If you should find yourself in the position of insisting that you are right break your own pattern. Stop immedietly and come back to the discussion later when you're in a better state to resolve your conflicts</li>

<li>Develop a pattern interrupt that you both agree to use when things become most heated. In this way.no matter how mad you are, for at least a moment you can smile and let go of the upset. To make it easier for both of you, use the most bizarre or humerous pattern interrupt that you can devise.</li>

<li>When you feel resistance, communicate it with softness. 5 Plan regular date nights together, preferably once a week, or at the minimum, two times a month. Take turns surprising your partner and dreaming up the most romantic and fun things to do.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Day Four: Financial destiny</h2>

<p>Your outcome: take Immediate control of your financial future by learning the five foundational elements for establishing wealth.</P>

<p>Everything in this book is based upon the idea that we have the power to understand how our minds, bodies, and emotions work, and because of this, we have the capacity to exert a great deal of control over our destinies. Our financial world is no different. We must understand it and not limit ourselves by beliefs about the complexity of finances. Once you understand the fundamentals, mastering money is a fairly simple matter. So the first task I would give you in taking control of your financial world is to utilize the NAC (neuro-associative Conditioning) technology to condition yourself for financial success. Become clearly associated with all the great things you could do for your family and the peace of mind you'd feel if you had true economic abundance.</P>

<p>Many people make the mistake of thinking that all the challenges in their lives would dissipate if they just had enough money. Nothing could be further from the truth. Earning more money, in and of itself, rarely frees people. It is equaly ridiculous to tell yourself that greater financial freedom and mastery of your finances would not offer you greater opportunities to expand, share, and create value for yourself and others.</P>

<p>So why do so many people fail to achieve financial abundance in a country where economic opportunity surrounds us? The most common reason why people do not become financially successful is that they have mixed associations to what it would take to have more money. We might believe that making more money would entail working hard at a job that we would not enjoy. These negative associations are not limited to ourselves. Some people resent anyone who is doing well financially, and often they assume that the erson must have done something to take advantage of others. If you find yourself resenting someone who is wealthy, what message does that send to the brain. (I know I think wealthy people are not concerned about social issues). The second most common reason why so many people never master money is simply because they think it is too complex. The third most common belief that keeps people from succeeding financially is the concept of scarcity. Most people believe they live in a world where everything is limited. The truth of the mater however, is that concerning a scarce supply no longer guarantees lasting wealth. Economist Paul Pilzer's economic theory alchemy (in his book 'unlimited wealth') points out that we are in a unique time in human history, where the traditional idea fobtaining scarce physical resources is no longer the primary arbiter of wealth. Today, technology determines the value of a physical resource and how large a supply of it actually exists. This is a common mistake made by some of the most powerful people in today's society who continue to operate using the old formula for creating wealth. You and I need to realize that the value of anything is dependant upon technology. Technology can turn a waste product into an unvaluable resource. After all, there was a time when having oil on your land was a curse, but technology turned it into a source of wealth. True wealth, paul says, comes form the ability to practice 'economic alchemy'; which is the ability to take something that has very little value and convert it into something of significantly greater value.</P>

<p><b>The Five fundamental lessons for creating lasting wealth:</b></P>

<ol>


<li>Earn more income than ever before. How? The key to wealth is to make yourself more valuable. If you have more skills, more ability, more intelligence, specialized knowledge, a capacity to do things that few others can do, or if you can think creatively and contribute on a massive scale, you can earn more money than you every thought possible. The single most important and potent way to expand your income is to devise a way to consistently add real value to people's lives, and you will prosper. For example, entrapraneurs add value to society by creating products and services that increase the quality of the lives for their customers, and they also create jobs for people.

If you want to earn more money where you are today, one of the simplest ways to do so is to ask yourself" how can I be worth more to this company'? How can I help it achieve more in less time? How can I add a tremendous amount of value to it? What new system or technology can I develop? If we can help people to do more with less, than we are truly empowering others, and we will be empowered economically as well, as long as we put ourselves in a position to do so.</li>

<li>The second key is to maintain your wealth. Contrary to popular opinion you cannot maintain wealth by simply continuing to earn money. You must spend less than you earn, and invest the difference. You must pick a specific percentage of your income that you will invest each year up front. We all know about the virtue of saving a minimum of 10 percent and inveting it but very few people do it. To take control of your wealth, you must take control of your spending-He suggests "don't develop a budget, develop a spending plan" truly if a budget is done effectively, it is a spending plan. It is a means for you to decide what you want to spend your money on in advance rather than get caught up in the moment.</li>

<li>The third key is to increase your wealth. How do you accomplish this? You must spend less than you earn, invest the difference, and re-invest your returns for compound growth. You might say this is wonderful ! would love to begin my compounding investment but how do I know what to invest in? There is no simple answer to this question. You must first decide what your financial goals are. What do you want to accomplish, and in what period of time? What is your risk tolerance', the amount of risk that you are comfortable with? Without a clear understanding of your desires, your needs, and your potential concerns, what to invest in is not clear. The most important thing you'll ever do in your financial life is to decide to truly understand the various types of investments and what their potential risks and returns are. Responsible advisors will make certain that all of their clients thoroughly understand the kinds of investments that are available and that they can take part in the development of their own financial plans. Without a clear-cut investment plan you will eventually fail financially fortunaty the answer to many of your questions are available in books. </li>

<li> The fourth key is to protect your wealth. (legal American info)</li>

<li>The fifth key is to enjoy your wealth. He talks about the power of tithing. By giving away a portion of what you earn, you are teaching your brain that you have more than enough. Remember that true wealth is an emotion; it is a sense of abundance.</li>

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<ul>
<li>take a look at your beliefs and see if any of them are out of line.</li>

<li>Institute a process for adding more value in your place of employment.</li>

<li>Commit to saving 10 percent, and have it deduced from your check and invested into your portfolio</li>

<li>Get some financial coaching.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Day five: Be impeccable: your code of conduct<h2>

<p>Your outcome: Is it possible to have great values, to have all your rules aligned to support them, to be asking yourself the right questions, and not to be living your values in the moment? If you are being honest with yourself, you know the answer is yes. All of us at one time or another have let events control us, instead of controlling our states or our decisions as to what those events mean. We need a clear-cut way to ensure that we consistently live the values to which we've committed ourselves, and a way of measuring whether or not we're actually achieving that value on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>Activity</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<li>Make a list of the states you are committed to experience every day in order to live in accordance with your highest principles and values.</li>

<li>After you have compiled your lifest, write a sentence next to each one describing how you will now you are
doing it.</li>

<li>Make the commitment to yourself to geniuinely experience each of these stats at least once a day. Create a "code of condcut' for yourself and revisit it often.</li>

<h2>Day six: master your time and your life</h2>

<p>Your outcome: learn how to use time to your advantage rather than allowing it to rule your levels of
satisfaction and stress. So often we forget that time is a mental construct, that it is completely relative, and that our experience of time is almost exclusively the result of our mental focus. Let us review and apply three time saving tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ability to distort time- our beliefs filter our perception of time. For some people twenty minutes is a lifetime. Their perception of time will change how they think, plan, and even add to their stress levels. We must direct our focus and consciously choose how to measure our time. How do you define your use of time? Are you spending it, wasting it, or killing it?</li>

<li>A matter of importance-the most critical distinction of all, is an understanding of how urgency and importance control your decisions about what to do with your time, and therefore your level of personal fulfillment. What do I mean? Let me ask you this: Have you ever worked your tail off, completed every single thing on your to-do list, but at the end of the day still felt unfulfilled? That is because you did everything that was urgent and demanded your attention in the moment, but you did not do what was important- the things that would make a difference in the long-term. Urgency controls our lives. The only way to truly master your time is to organize your schedule each day to spend the majority of it doing things that are important rather than urgent.</li>

<li>Save yourself years-the most poweful way I've learned to compress time is to learn through other peoples experiences. Modelling those who've already succeeded can save you years of pain. This is why it is important to read very often and play the role of the student your whole life.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Day seven: Rest and Play</h3>

<p>Your outcome: achieve some balance by planning a day of excitement for yourself. What would that be? Do it. The book ends with the final chapter emphasizing the fact that we have the power to control how we think, feel, and what we do. And it is the small decisions we make every day that create our destinies. With out actions, we communicate our most deeply held values and beliefs. And while we do not have control over many external factors we do have control over our internal world-which is really what shapes our decisions and actions. So once we change ourselves we can act in ways to shape the decisions and actions of others to create change in the world. </p>
