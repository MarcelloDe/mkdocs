# SQL Introduction

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL allows you to query, insert, update, and delete data from databases, making it an essential tool for data analysts, developers, and anyone working with data.

SQL enables you to extract meaningful insights from large datasets by writing queries that filter, aggregate, and organize information according to your needs. Whether you're retrieving specific records, joining multiple tables, or performing complex calculations, SQL provides a powerful and standardized way to interact with database systems.
