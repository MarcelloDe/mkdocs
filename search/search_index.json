Dominant lobsters, with confident posture, thrive, while weaker ones internalize a \"loser\" status. This applies to humans as well. We constantly assess each other, and our posture influences how we're perceived. He connects posture to psychology, explaining how depression can become a negative feedback loop. Bullying can have lasting effects, leading to habitual submissive posturing.</p> <p>Peterson stresses the importance of self-protective anger. The ability to be aggressive can, paradoxically, reduce the need for actual aggression. Standing up for yourself early sets boundaries. He recommends using \"I don't\" statements (rather than \"I can't\") and framing rejections impersonally. He cautions against naive assumptions about inherent goodness, warning that such naivete can invite abuse. Recognizing the potential for darkness within oneself can decrease fear and increase self-respect.</p> <p>While acknowledging that some people may be stuck in negative patterns, Peterson emphasizes that change is possible. Positive feedback loops, like the Matthew Effect, demonstrate how small advantages can compound over time. Standing up straight is not just physical; it's metaphysical. It's about voluntarily accepting the burden of being and facing life's challenges.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-2-treat-yourself-like-someone-you-are-responsible-for-helping","title":"Rule 2 : Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping","text":"<p>Peterson explores the paradox of how easily we care for pets while neglecting ourselves. He links this to shame and unworthiness, inherited from the story of Adam and Eve. We see ourselves as \"fallen\" and undeserving. He challenges the cynicism that assumes everyone is selfish, pointing out that many struggle with self-disgust. He reinterprets the Golden Rule as an equation: we must love ourselves before we can truly love others.</p> <p>He highlights the everyday heroism of people coping with hardship. He argues that we deserve respect and are morally obligated to care for ourselves. This means treating ourselves with the same compassion we'd offer a loved one. This isn't about indulgence; it's about discerning what is truly good for us. Just as we guide children, we must guide ourselves towards virtue, responsibility, and health. We need to envision our best future, understand our limitations, and chart a course toward hope.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-3-make-friends-with-people-who-want-the-best-for-you","title":"Rule 3 : Make friends with people who want the best for you","text":"<p>Peterson uses anecdotes from his hometown to illustrate how peer influence can shape lives. He discusses \"repetition compulsion,\" where people unconsciously choose friends who replicate past traumas. He cautions against the \"rescue complex,\" driven by vanity, and stresses that not everyone can be saved. He warns against assuming victimhood and emphasizes personal responsibility.</p> <p>He suggests that some friendships are based on sacrificing the future for the present. He questions the motives of those who appear \"good,\" suggesting they may prioritize appearances over genuine help. He recommends getting your own life in order before trying to rescue others. He emphasizes choosing friends who support our upward trajectory, challenge our negativity, and encourage our best selves.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-4-compare-yourself-to-who-you-were-yesterday-not-to-who-someone-else-is-today","title":"Rule 4 : Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today","text":"<p>Peterson explains that comparing ourselves to others is natural in youth, but becomes less relevant as we mature. \"Winning\" isn't always external; it can be personal growth. He cautions against overvaluing what we lack and undervaluing what we have. \"Good\" isn't simply obedience; it requires a positive trajectory. He encourages readers to \"dare to be dangerous\" and articulate what justifies their lives.</p> <p>He acknowledges the unease that comes with foresight and suggests self-assessment. He encourages using the past as a guide, but emphasizes the power to shape the future through small, consistent improvements. He discusses religion's role in providing values and defines faith as a commitment to the goodness of being. He advises examining our lives, identifying problems, and starting small. This aligns with \"telling the truth,\" which is paying attention and negotiating with reality. This reduces envy and allows us to focus on personal growth.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-5-do-not-let-your-children-do-anything-that-makes-you-dislike-them","title":"Rule 5 : Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them","text":"<p>This chapter focuses on parenting, discipline, and instilling social norms. Peterson argues that parents act as representatives of culture, teaching children how to behave and preparing them for the world. It's about helping children become functional, responsible adults, not just about parental affection. It emphasizes the importance of setting clear boundaries and enforcing consequences. He stresses that parents should not try to be their children\u2019s friends, but rather figures of authority who provide structure and guidance. He discusses the importance of teaching children to respect authority and to delay gratification.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-6-set-your-house-in-perfect-order-before-you-criticize-the-world","title":"Rule 6 : Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world","text":"<p>Peterson acknowledges life's cruelty but warns against resentment and hatred. While vengeance is understandable, it hinders positive change. He uses Solzhenitsyn as an example of individual transformation. He suggests that suffering is normal, but if it becomes unbearable and corrupting, it's time for self-reflection. He advises examining circumstances, fulfilling responsibilities, and addressing personal issues. He asks: \"Have you cleaned up your life?\" If not, he recommends starting by stopping what we know is wrong. He urges humility, suggesting we focus on our own lives before criticizing the world.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-7-pursue-what-is-meaningful-not-what-is-expedient","title":"Rule 7 : Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)","text":"<p>Peterson introduces the concept of the future as a \"judgmental father\" and the importance of sacrifice. He asks: what should be sacrificed? He explores the development of delayed gratification and the social contract. He suggests the greatest sacrifice is often what we love most. If our world isn't what we want, we must examine our values. He uses Abraham and Isaac and the story of Christ to illustrate this.</p> <p>He revisits Adam and Eve, highlighting the knowledge of good and evil and its implications. He argues that the central problem is not just reducing suffering, but reducing evil. He discusses Christ's encounter with Satan, where Satan embodies the refusal of sacrifice. He emphasizes the importance of rejecting immediate gratification and the temptations of evil. He argues that meaning is found in voluntary sacrifice for a greater purpose.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-8-tell-the-truthor-at-least-dont-lie","title":"Rule 8 : Tell the truth\u2014or, at least, don\u2019t lie","text":"<p>Peterson discusses how language can be used to manipulate. He describes \"life-lies\" \u2013 attempts to manipulate reality to achieve a desired outcome. He uses the example of someone who avoids conflict at the cost of meaning. He emphasizes the importance of saying \"no\" when necessary and the dangers of always saying \"yes.\" He contrasts authenticity with inauthenticity. He argues that the prideful mind is tempted to ignore error.</p> <p>He suggests that instead of lying, we should set ambitions, even if uncertain. He emphasizes that better ambitions are related to character and ability rather than status and power. He argues that an aim provides structure for action, reduces anxiety, and defines progress.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-9-assume-the-person-you-are-listening-to-might-know-something-you-dont","title":"Rule 9 : Assume the person you are listening to might know something you don't","text":"<p>This rule emphasizes the importance of active listening and intellectual humility. Peterson argues that we should approach conversations with the assumption that the other person might have valuable insights or perspectives that we haven't considered. This doesn't mean blindly accepting everything they say, but it means being open to the possibility of learning something new. It requires setting aside our own biases and preconceptions and genuinely trying to understand the other person's point of view. Peterson connects this to the idea of integrating new information into our understanding of the world, which is essential for growth and development.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-10-be-precise-in-your-speech","title":"Rule 10 : Be precise in your speech","text":"<p>Peterson argues that clear and precise language is essential for clear thinking. Vague or ambiguous language can obscure our thoughts and make it difficult to communicate effectively. He emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for our words and using them carefully. He believes that by striving for precision in our speech, we can also improve the clarity of our thinking and our understanding of the world.

Peterson argues that boys have a natural tendency towards rough and tumble play, which is important for their physical and social development. He cautions against overly restrictive or protective parenting that stifles this natural inclination. He uses skateboarding as an example of a risky activity that can help boys develop courage, resilience, and other valuable qualities. He emphasizes the importance of allowing children to take risks and learn from their mistakes. This rule is not advocating for reckless behavior, but rather for allowing children the freedom to explore and develop their own capabilities.</p>"},{"location":"Book%20Summaries/12%20Rules%20for%20Life.html#rule-12-pet-a-cat-when-you-encounter-one-on-the-street","title":"Rule 12 : Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street","text":"<p>This seemingly simple rule encapsulates many of Peterson's ideas. It's about appreciating small moments of beauty and joy, even amidst suffering. It's a reminder to be present, find meaning in the everyday, and acknowledge the value of even the smallest creatures.

The book doesn't just offer tips and tricks; it explores the emotional and self-esteem issues that often sabotage our best intentions.</p> <p>The book opens by examining the famous \"marshmallow test,\" highlighting how our ability to delay gratification is linked to future success. However, Kelsey goes further, questioning why some children develop this ability while others don't. He connects this to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, suggesting that a lack of self-esteem, stemming from unmet needs for love, belonging, and acceptance, can hinder our motivation and ability to acquire productive skills. Essentially, if we don't feel worthy, we won't be motivated to achieve.</p> <p>While acknowledging that diagnoses like ADHD or personality assessments like Myers-Briggs can provide insights, Kelsey emphasizes that the core issue is often a toxic internal critic born from low self-esteem. He argues that true productivity can only begin once we understand our role in our own dysfunction.</p> <p>Self-belief is identified as the missing ingredient. Procrastination, the book argues, is rooted in a complex web of emotions \u2013 fears, hopes, memories, doubts, and pressures \u2013 that manifest as distorted, all-or-nothing thinking. Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>\"Everything I do must come easily.\"</li> <li>\"I should have no limitations.\"</li> <li>\"If it's not perfect, it's not worth doing.\"</li> <li>\"There's a right answer, and I'm waiting to find it.\"</li> </ul> <p>Low self-esteem can also lead to self-sabotage. If we believe we're undeserving of success, we unconsciously adopt behaviors that prevent it. Kelsey stresses the importance of raising our \"deserve level.\"</p> <p>Motivation is crucial. Kelsey, drawing on Tom Gorman's work, identifies feeling undeserving, fear, comparison, and blame as the enemies of motivation.

Sincere appreciation fuels this desire and motivates positive behavior. Distinguish between flattery (insincere) and appreciation (genuine). Focus on acknowledging and nurturing the positive traits and accomplishments of others. Lack of appreciation can be detrimental to relationships.</p> <p>Lesson Three: Arouse in the Other Person an Eager Want</p> <p>The key to influencing others is to talk about what they want, not what you want.

Show genuine interest in others by listening attentively, asking questions, and remembering details about their lives. This genuine interest is the foundation of building strong friendships. Trying to impress others is less effective than being genuinely interested in them.</p> <p>Lesson Two: Smile</p> <p>A smile is a powerful nonverbal cue that conveys warmth, friendliness, and acceptance. It's contagious and can significantly impact how others perceive you. Happiness is an internal choice; choose to smile and create a positive atmosphere. Even on the phone, a smile can be \"heard.\"</p> <p>Lesson Three: Remember that a Person's Name Is to That Person the Sweetest and Most Important Sound in Any Language</p> <p>Remembering and using someone's name shows respect and makes them feel valued. It's a small gesture that can make a big difference in building rapport.</p> <p>Lesson Four: Be a Good Listener, Encourage Others to Talk About Themselves</p> <p>Being a good listener is essential for effective communication. Encourage others to share their thoughts and feelings by asking open-ended questions and actively listening to their responses. People are far more interested in themselves than in you.</p> <p>Lesson Five: Talk in Terms of the Other Person's Interests</p> <p>Tailor your conversations to the other person's interests. Do your research and be prepared to discuss topics that are meaningful to them. This shows that you value their perspectives and are genuinely interested in connecting with them. Theodore Roosevelt was a master of this.</p> <p>Lesson Six: Make Other People Feel Important \u2013 And Do So Sincerely</p> <p>Everyone wants to feel important. Find ways to genuinely acknowledge and appreciate the contributions and accomplishments of others. A little sincere appreciation can go a long way in building strong relationships.

Be honest, admit your own errors, and look for areas of agreement.</p> <p>Lesson Two: Show Respect for Other People's Opinions. Never Say \"You're Wrong.\"</p> <p>Avoid directly contradicting others. Instead, use phrases like \"I may be wrong, but...\" or \"I see your point, but...\" to express your perspective without being confrontational. Subtlety is key when trying to influence others.</p> <p>Lesson Three: If You Are Wrong, Admit It Quickly and Emphatically</p> <p>Admitting your mistakes demonstrates humility and builds trust. It also disarms potential criticism and creates a more open and honest dialogue. It's better to criticize yourself before someone else does.</p> <p>Lesson Four: Begin in a Friendly Way</p> <p>Approach every interaction with a friendly and positive attitude.

The more they talk, the more you learn about their perspectives and motivations. Don't interrupt, even if you disagree.</p> <p>Lesson Seven: Let the Other Person Feel That the Idea Is His or Hers</p> <p>People are more likely to embrace ideas they feel they've come up with themselves. Instead of dictating solutions, guide others towards discovering them on their own.</p> <p>Lesson Eight: Try Honestly to See From the Other Person's Point of View</p> <p>Empathy is crucial for effective communication.

This also helps with the data cleaning process. I can take my dataset into a program called \u2018Open Refine\u2019 and visually see what my data is doing. Here for example, I can see that some numbers are type numerically and some are entered as text. </p> <p> &lt;span class=\"caption text-muted)OpenRefine allows me to model and clean my data</p> <p><p>I will save my excel file in .csv format so that I can work with it in Python; or more particularly, Jupyter Notebook and conduct some more EDA and Data Cleaning.</p></p> <p><p> Let's see what the data types are that we are working with</p> </p> <p><p>Second I want to see if there are any NaN data types or missing values.</p></p> <p></p> <p><p>Lastly, I want to see that there is nothing spelled wrong or out of place, that all my \u2018unique values\u2019 are what I expect them to be. </p></p> <p> &lt;span class=\"caption text-muted)I see my data types are 'objects' although I will change them accordingly </p>  Now let's answer those questions  <p></p> Question Set 1 (Answers) <p>1.  I found three instances of inconsistent input of the data in this column </p> <p></p> <p>2. While the data type is mostly numeric there are three cells that are written in-text: \u2018zero\u2019 \u2018zero\u2019 \u2018twenty five\u2019.</p> <p> 3. Using OpenRefine, I sorted through the data looking for unclean data. The software allows me to sort by \u2018data types\u2019 and while I would expect numeric data in the \u2018infraction_weight\u2019 column I can see there are outliers of an inconsistent data type; string and text. </p> <p></p> <p>4. OpenRefine allows me to configure each problematic cell by replacing the text data with the numeric data while also changing the data type to \u2018numeric\u2019.  </p> <p></p> <p></p> Question Set 2 (Answers) <p>1. The placeholder used when an inspector found no infraction is inputted as 'NO_VIOLATIONS_FOUND' </p> <p>2.By examination I've simply extrapolated that the  corresponding column \u2018infraction_weight\u2019 unanimously show that there is zero infraction weight in every instance that no violation was found. Using SQL I can run a query to visually see how many instances an input of \u2018NO_VIOLATIONS_FOUND\u2019 corresponded with an infraction weight of any number other than zero and there isn\u2019t a single instance, nor is there a single instance of any other infraction code corresponding with an infraction weight of zero. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> Question Set 3 (Answers) <p>1. I wanted to find out which companies were responsible for the bulk of the violations but also factor in the weight of the violations as well to see who the biggest violators were. I found the following companies to be the top 5 violators in the data:  <ul> <li>Company_0788</li> <li>Company_0309</li> <li>Company_0945</li> <li>Company_0206</li> <li>Company_0122</li> </ul> </p> <p></p> <p> 2. Using Python\u2019s \u2018pandas\u2019 library I created a new feature that was a simple average of the infraction weight incurred by each company, found by summing the infraction weights and dividing by that specific company\u2019s infraction count. It was found that some companies might have had many infractions, but an overall lower infraction weight, while others had many infractions, weighing higher.</p> <p></p> <p> 3. Using Power B.I.: I can see that the average weight of infractions drops to its lowest in the month of July. This was done by plotting the infraction weight averages within each month in the year of 2018 found in the dataset. </p> <p></p> <p> -End- Thank you for your time. </p>"},{"location":"projects/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Certification%20Capstone%20Project.html","title":"IBM Data Science Certification Capstone","text":"IBM Data Science Certification Capstone: Battle of the Neighbourhood  <p>The objective of this capstone project is to implement three vital steps: leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve. </p> <p> This project is approached by following three critical steps</p> <p>First, by making calls to the ForeSquare API which will return a  JSON file return to us that matches our query. </p> <p>Second, Create or structure a dataframe that creates clusters or segments of your city.

Found here: https:/open.hamilton.ca/datasets/cccae6f029334927856da6e20a50561f_19/explore?location=43.260818%2C-79.920750%2C11.91</p> <p> The post-secondary schools in the Hamilton area </p> <p>The second dataset is the list of restaurants and the categories they fall in found using the Foresquare API: https:/developer.foursquare.com</p> My Methodology and EDA <p> First, the data was cleaned and \u2018grouped\u2019 because it was initially not worthy for analysis such as the example of the \u2018categories\u2019 as seen in the image here for example. </p> <p></p> <p>Secondly, the datasets had to be parsed because they were much too large and had a lot of data that I did not require. I parsed the restaurant categories down for further analysis by using the \u2018get dummies\u2019 method as seen in the image below. </p> <p></p> <p>Finally, the K-means clustering is used to perform the clustering of restaurants. My intention was to create as many clusters of as many \u2018categories\u2019 of restaurants existed in my dataset which was around 24 categories. The map itself tells the  rest of the story and is up for critique as well as interpretation.</p> <p></p> Results  <p>The result of this project was the map that was created at the end. The yellow points on the map indicate a post-secondary institution, which when clicked will tell you the name of the institution. The blue points indicate restaurant category clusters. As you can see here there is some accuracy as we see a cluster of bars close to the downtown post-secondary institution as an example. </p> <p></p> Discussion <p>As a beginner to Python as well as using packages such as folium this project was a success in the sense that I gained a great deal of knowledge and experience from it such as executing the final code and map. I also got a sense of which ethnic restaurants I would like to now discover in my neighbourhood. </p> <p>Yet, upon close examination of my results there are certainly problems that need to be ironed out such as some clusters may simply say \u2018Restaurant cluster\u2019 which doesn\u2019t tell me anything. Of course, there is always room for improvement. </p> <p></p> <p>This is the end of my presentation. Let me know go into my step-by-step </p>  My Methods Step By Step  <p> 1. I Installed my libraries </p> <p></p> <p>2. I then input my client ID and Password to access the Foresquare API </p> <p></p> <p> 3. I then input my geo-location parameters into the geolocator so that I could start with a map of Hamilton. I then \u2018request\u2019 the information for all the restaurants in a particular radius.</p> <p></p> <p> 4. The data is returned as a JSON file and not yet parsed and organized so I will do that next.</p> <p></p> <p> 5. The data is transformed and organized into something easier to work with.</p> <p></p> <p> 6. I further organize and clean the data so that I am left with only the data points that I need.</p> <p></p> <p> 7.I group the restaurants together and using folium I place them onto my map.</p> <p></p> <p> 8. I implemented \u2018one-hot\u2019 encoding to create categorical data variables to prepare my data points for  k-means clustering.</p> <p></p> <p> 9. k-means clustering</p> <p></p> <p>10.I use matplotlib lib to plot my data points onto my map. </p> <p></p> <p>And Finally, here are the results of the restaurant clusters created around my centroids being the Post-Secondary Schools: Mohawk College and McMaster University. </p> <p></p> <p></p>  -End- Thank you for reading"},{"location":"projects/SQL%20and%20Databases%20Project.html","title":"IBM Data Science Certification: SQL and Database Project","text":"IBM Data Science Certification SQL and Database Project <p>This assignment involves 3 datasets for the city of Chicago obtained from the Chicago Data Portal: </p> <p>1.
